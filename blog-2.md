==> How to handle asynchronous operations using async/await over callback/promise TypeScript.



Handling asynchronous operations in TypeScript can be challenging, especially when using callbacks or promises. Callbacks, where one function is passed into another to execute once an operation completes, can lead to "callback hell"—code that's deeply nested and hard to read. Promises simplify this by allowing operations to be chained with .then(), but complex logic can still become cluttered and difficult to debug.

async/await in TypeScript offers a clean and readable alternative. Declaring a function as async allows it to return a promise automatically, while await pauses the function execution until the promise resolves, letting you write asynchronous code as if it were synchronous. This approach eliminates nesting and enhances readability:


With async/await, error handling is more streamlined through try/catch blocks, making complex flows easier to manage. Overall, it’s a more efficient and readable way to handle asynchronous operations, improving both the code's structure and maintainability in TypeScript applications.
